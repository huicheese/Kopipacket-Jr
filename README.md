**Challenge Description**
-------------------------

A psychopath who has been force-feeding children thumbdrives has been caught recently. Under interrogation, he says nothing but ***"I need to wake up"***. The only clue that the police has is that the psychopath goes by the name ***Edih Gets***. According to the psychiatrist, ***Dr Habin Muhammad Lee***, who has been the lead psychiatrist in studying this case, says that this psychopath enjoys ***hiding things***. After surgically extracting the thumbdrives from children, and after conducting deep analysis, digital forensics analyst ***Dr Ahahanaf Pole Cdkey*** has provided the one and only file that could still be read from the only viable thumbdrive.

You are now given the file that ***Dr Ahahanaf Pole Cdkey*** has extracted, and the police needs your help in finding out exactly what and why is ***Edih Gets*** doing this, and they believe that the file would give you clues to it.

After working with the forensics team, both ***Dr Habin Muhammad Lee*** and ***Dr Ahahanaf Pole Cdkey*** found that the final answer to that question is a string of words. In order for this evidence to be accepted in the courts, please use the format ***kopiCTF{ }*** with the answer placed inside ***{ }***.
